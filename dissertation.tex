% We'll use the uathesis document class (duh).  The uncommented line below will produce a Dissertation, the others would produce a Thesis.
% There are other options available to you like turning on the copyright statement and replacing the year on the title page with a "generated on" stamp (handy for early drafts).
% To find out what the available options are, take a look into the uathesis.cls file and look for the \DeclareOption commands near the top of that file.
% There are five copyright options.  Copyright, no copyright, and three different Creative Commons licenses.
% The draft and Final options are also recommended.  The draft option will enable faster compile time and the final option will turn off todo notes.
